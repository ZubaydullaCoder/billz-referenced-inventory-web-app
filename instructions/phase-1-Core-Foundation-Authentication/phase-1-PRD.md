Excellent. Acting as the **Product Manager**, I will now draft the Product Requirements Document for the first part of Phase 1. This PRD focuses on the critical path for a new user: registering for the service and having their initial store environment created automatically.

Here is the PRD for **Feature 1.1: User Registration & Initial Store Setup**.

---

### **PRD Module 1: Core Foundation & Authentication**

#### **Feature 1.1: User Registration & Initial Store Setup**

**1. Feature Summary**

This feature covers the complete user registration process. A new user must be able to create an account using their email and a password. Critically, upon successful registration, the system must automatically generate a new, default "Store" and link it to the new user account. This ensures that every user has a functional workspace from their very first login.

**2. User Stories**

- **User Story 1.1.1:** As a new small business owner, I want to sign up for OsonSavdo with my email and a secure password, so I can create an account and start exploring the application.
- **User Story 1.1.2:** As a new user, I want the system to automatically create a default store for me upon registration, so I don't have to perform any manual setup and can begin adding products immediately.
- **User Story 1.1.3:** As a prospective user, if I try to register with an email that is already in use, I want to be clearly informed of the error, so I can either try a different email or proceed to the login page.

**3. Functional Requirements (FR)**

- **FR 1.1.1 - Registration Form:**

  - The system must provide a public-facing registration page (`/auth/register`).
  - The form must include the following fields:
    - `Full Name` (Text, Required)
    - `Email Address` (Email, Required)
    - `Password` (Password, Required)
  - The password field must enforce a minimum security standard: at least 6 characters long.
  - Client-side validation must provide real-time feedback for required fields and email format.

- **FR 1.1.2 - Account Creation Logic:**

  - The system must use `Auth.js` (NextAuth.js) with the "Credentials" provider for email/password authentication.
  - Upon form submission, the system must validate that the provided email address does not already exist in the `User` table.
  - If the email is unique, the system must hash the provided password before storing it in the database. Passwords must **never** be stored in plain text.

- **FR 1.1.3 - Atomic Store Creation:**

  - The creation of a `User` record and its associated `Store` record must be an atomic transaction. If either part of the operation fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back to prevent orphaned data (e.g., a user without a store).
  - A new `Store` record must be created with a default name, "Main Store".
  - The new `User` must be linked to the new `Store` (e.g., via a `userId` foreign key on the `Store` model or a similar relational link).

- **FR 1.1.4 - Post-Registration Flow:**
  - Upon successful creation of both the `User` and `Store`, the user must be automatically logged into the application.
  - After being logged in, the user must be redirected to the main application dashboard (`/dashboard`).

**4. Acceptance Criteria (AC)**

- **AC 1.1.1: Successful Registration and Redirection**

  - **Given** a new user is on the `/auth/register` page.
  - **When** they fill in a valid Full Name, a unique email address, and a password of 6 or more characters, and click "Sign Up".
  - **Then** a new `User` record is created in the database with the provided details and a hashed password.
  - **And** a new `Store` record is created with the name "Main Store" and is associated with the new user.
  - **And** the user is redirected to the `/dashboard` page and is in a logged-in state.

- **AC 1.1.2: Registration with an Existing Email**

  - **Given** a user with the email "test@example.com" already exists in the system.
  - **When** a new user attempts to register with the email "test@example.com".
  - **Then** the system must prevent the creation of a new account.
  - **And** a clear error message must be displayed on the registration form, such as "An account with this email already exists."

- **AC 1.1.3: Password Security Validation**

  - **Given** a user is on the `/auth/register` page.
  - **When** they attempt to submit the form with a password that is fewer than 6 characters long.
  - **Then** the form submission must be blocked.
  - **And** a validation message must appear, indicating "Password must be at least 6 characters long."

- **AC 1.1.4: Required Field Validation**
  - **Given** a user is on the `/auth/register` page.
  - **When** they attempt to submit the form without filling in the "Full Name" or "Email" fields.
  - **Then** the form submission must be blocked.
  - **And** a validation message must appear next to the empty required fields.

Please review this PRD. Once you confirm, I will proceed to draft the PRD for the next feature in this phase: **Feature 1.2: User Login & Session Management**.

Understood. Continuing in my role as **Product Manager**, here is the PRD for the next essential feature in this phase. This document details the login process, session handling, and the critical security measure of protecting application routes.

---

### **PRD Module 1: Core Foundation & Authentication**

#### **Feature 1.2: User Login, Session Management & Route Protection**

**1. Feature Summary**

This feature enables registered users to securely access the application. It defines the login mechanism, the management of user sessions, and the protection of all internal application routes. Unauthenticated users will be prevented from accessing any business-related pages, ensuring data privacy and security.

**2. User Stories**

- **User Story 1.2.1:** As a registered user, I want to log in with my email and password, so I can access my store's dashboard and manage my business.
- **User Story 1.2.2:** As a logged-in user, I want a way to log out of the application, so I can securely end my session on a shared or public computer.
- **User Story 1.2.3:** As a user attempting to log in, if I enter the wrong credentials, I want to be clearly notified of the error so I can correct my mistake and try again.
- **User Story 1.2.4:** As an unauthenticated visitor, I want to be prevented from accessing internal application pages (like `/dashboard` or `/products`) and be automatically redirected to the login page, to ensure the security of store data.

**3. Functional Requirements (FR)**

- **FR 1.2.1 - Login Form:**

  - The system must provide a public-facing login page at `/auth/login`.
  - The form must include the following fields:
    - `Email Address` (Email, Required)
    - `Password` (Password, Required)
  - The form must include a clear link to the registration page (`/auth/register`) for users who do not yet have an account.

- **FR 1.2.2 - Authentication Logic:**

  - The system will use the `Auth.js` "Credentials" provider to handle the login attempt.
  - On submission, the backend must look up the user by the provided email address.
  - If a user is found, the system must securely compare the provided password against the hashed password stored in the database.
  - If the user is not found or the password does not match, the system must return a generic authentication error. This is to prevent attackers from confirming which emails are registered in the system (user enumeration).

- **FR 1.2.3 - Session Management:**

  - Upon successful authentication, `Auth.js` will create and manage a user session (e.g., via secure, http-only cookies containing a JWT).
  - The user must be redirected to the main application dashboard (`/dashboard`) immediately after a successful login.

- **FR 1.2.4 - Logout Functionality:**

  - A "Logout" action must be available within the main application layout, accessible to all logged-in users (e.g., inside a user profile dropdown).
  - Triggering the "Logout" action must securely terminate the user's session on the server.
  - After logout, the user must be redirected to the login page (`/auth/login`).

- **FR 1.2.5 - Protected Routes Middleware:**
  - The system must implement middleware to protect all application routes by default, with the exception of public pages (e.g., `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, landing page).
  - This middleware will check for a valid user session on every incoming request to a protected page.
  - If an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected URL, the middleware must intercept the request and redirect them to the login page.

**4. Acceptance Criteria (AC)**

- **AC 1.2.1: Successful User Login**

  - **Given** a registered user is on the `/auth/login` page.
  - **When** they enter their correct email and password and submit the form.
  - **Then** the system validates their credentials successfully.
  - **And** they are redirected to the `/dashboard` page with an active session.

- **AC 1.2.2: Login with Invalid Credentials**

  - **Given** a user is on the `/auth/login` page.
  - **When** they enter a correct email but an incorrect password.
  - **Then** authentication must fail.
  - **And** a clear, generic error message (e.g., "Invalid email or password") must be displayed on the form.
  - **And** the user remains on the `/auth/login` page.

- **AC 1.2.3: Attempted Access to Protected Route while Unauthenticated**

  - **Given** a user is not logged in.
  - **When** they attempt to navigate their browser directly to the `/products` URL.
  - **Then** they must be immediately redirected to the `/auth/login` page.

- **AC 1.2.4: Successful Logout and Session Termination**
  - **Given** a user is logged in and is viewing the `/dashboard` page.
  - **When** they click the "Logout" button.
  - **Then** their session is terminated.
  - **And** they are redirected to the `/auth/login` page.
  - **And** if they attempt to use the browser's "back" button to return to `/dashboard`, the route protection middleware must again redirect them to the login page.

This concludes the core authentication flow. The next logical step is to define the basic application shell that the user sees after logging in. Please confirm, and I will create the PRD for **Feature 1.3: Main Application Layout**.

Excellent. As the **Product Manager**, I will now define the requirements for the application's primary user interface structure. This layout is the shell that will house all other features, providing a consistent and predictable user experience.

---

### **PRD Module 1: Core Foundation & Authentication**

#### **Feature 1.3: Main Application Layout**

**1. Feature Summary**

This feature establishes the persistent user interface shell for authenticated users. It consists of a primary sidebar for navigation between different application modules and a header area for displaying the current context (like the active store) and providing access to user-specific actions such as logging out. This layout will be present on all pages within the authenticated part of the application, ensuring a consistent user experience.

**2. User Stories**

- **User Story 1.3.1:** As a store owner, I want a clear and persistent navigation menu on the side of my screen, so I can quickly and easily switch between key sections like my Dashboard, Products, and Sales.
- **User Story 1.3.2:** As a logged-in user, I want to always see which store I am currently managing and have an obvious way to access my account details or log out of the application.
- **User Story 1.3.3:** As a user on a mobile device, I want the navigation to adapt to my smaller screen so that it remains usable and doesn't clutter the main content.

**3. Functional Requirements (FR)**

- **FR 1.3.1 - Global Layout Structure:**

  - The system must implement a global layout using Next.js App Router's `layout.tsx` for all authenticated routes.
  - The layout will be divided into two main sections: a fixed sidebar on the left for navigation and a main content area on the right which includes a header and the page's content.

- **FR 1.3.2 - Sidebar Navigation Component:**

  - The sidebar must be visible on all authenticated pages.
  - It must contain a list of navigation links with both an icon and a text label. The initial set of links for the MVP are:
    - Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
    - Sales (POS) (`/pos`)
    - Products (`/products`)
    - Settings (`/settings`)
  - The navigation link corresponding to the currently active page must be visually highlighted (e.g., different background color or text weight).
  - The sidebar should be responsive, collapsing into a "hamburger" menu on smaller screen sizes (e.g., mobile devices).

- **FR 1.3.3 - Header Component:**

  - A header bar must be displayed at the top of the main content area.
  - The header must display the name of the user's currently active store (e.g., "Main Store"). This is a critical placeholder for future multi-store functionality.
  - The header must contain a User Profile dropdown menu on the far right.

- **FR 1.3.4 - User Profile Dropdown:**

  - The dropdown menu is triggered by clicking on the user's name or a profile icon.
  - The dropdown must display the user's `Full Name` and `Email Address`.
  - The dropdown must contain a "Logout" button which executes the logout functionality defined in PRD 1.2.

- **FR 1.3.5 - Main Content Area:**
  - This is the flexible part of the layout where the specific content for each page (e.g., the dashboard widgets, the product list) will be rendered.

**4. Acceptance Criteria (AC)**

- **AC 1.3.1: Layout Visibility and Structure**

  - **Given** a user has successfully logged in.
  - **When** they are viewing the `/dashboard` page.
  - **Then** the main application layout must be visible, containing a sidebar on the left and a main content area with a header on the right.

- **AC 1.3.2: Correct Navigation and Active State**

  - **Given** a user is logged in and is on the `/dashboard` page.
  - **When** they click the "Products" link in the sidebar.
  - **Then** the browser must navigate to the `/products` URL.
  - **And** the main content area must now render the content for the products page.
  - **And** the "Products" link in the sidebar must be visually highlighted, while the "Dashboard" link is no longer highlighted.

- **AC 1.3.3: Header Displays Correct Contextual Information**

  - **Given** a new user named "John Doe" with email "john@doe.com" has just registered.
  - **When** they are viewing any authenticated page.
  - **Then** the header must display the text "Main Store".
  - **And** the user profile dropdown in the header must display "John Doe" and "john@doe.com".

- **AC 1.3.4: Logout from Profile Dropdown**
  - **Given** a user is logged in.
  - **When** they click the user profile dropdown in the header and then click the "Logout" button.
  - **Then** they are successfully logged out and redirected to the `/auth/login` page, fulfilling the requirements of AC 1.2.4.
